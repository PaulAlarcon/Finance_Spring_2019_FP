    Options are traded both on exchanges and in the over-the-counter market.
    There are two types of option.

    (BUY) A call option
    gives the holder the right to buy the underlying asset
    by a certain date for a certain price.

    (SELL) A put option
    gives the holder the right to sell the underlying asset
    by a certain date for a certain price

    EXPIRATION DATE or maturity

    STRIKE PRICE or exercise price

    EUROPEANS OPTIONS can only be exercise at maturity

    AMERICAN OPTIONS can be exercise at any time up to maturity

    IMPORTANT :
    options give the holder the right to do something, he does not have to tho

    The price of a call option decreases as the strike price increases,
    while the price of a put option increases as the strike price increases

    The price of both options increase as the maturity increases

    FINANCIAL DERIVATIVE
    a derivative is a contract that derives its value from an underlying asset

    deltaT = (T - t0)/n
    u = e^(r*sqrt(deltaT) )
    d = 1/u
    e^-(r*deltaT)
    p = e^(r*deltaT) - d / ( u - d )
    q = 1 - p

    intrinsic value
    CALL max(st - K, O )
    PUT max(K - St, O)
    PAYOFF = SK - fairValue;

    //The higher the perceive risk, the higher the premium demanded by the market.

        however the the seller of the put has the obligation to buy at STRIKE price
        if buyer exercises the option
